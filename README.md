# Wordle++

Wordle but better - variable word length, guesses, difficulty, a timer, multiplayer leaderboards.

## How to set up for development

1. Make sure you have Nodejs installed
2. In cloned repository, run `corepack enable`, then `yarn`
3. To start the server, run `yarn dev`

## What everything is

- All code is in src, broken up by general type of file
- Package.json is what Node js reads the dependencies from
- To build the website or run it locally, follow those steps ^
- If you don't want to run it locally, you can go to [the website](wordlepluspl.us).
